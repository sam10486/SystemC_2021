India has been recording an average of 64,000 cases daily so far this month, 
down from more than 86,000 daily cases in the last two weeks of September. 
It's also a steep drop from earlier in September, when daily cases averaged
around 93,000. Daily deaths too have been declining in most states. But 
testing has remained consistent.
